# chEMBL-Data

This is a typical Bioinformatics project on drug discovery. Here in this project we extracted the HIV data set from the chEMBL data resource. The goal of the project was to find the activity or inactvity of Histone acetyltransferase KAT5. 
This way we could pin point and reduce the data to which organism it affects for example. This is a great project for beginers starting out in bioinformatics.
